							<h3>Sports</h3>
							<p>Sports are the most common extracurricular activity for kids in the CMA. Swimming lessons, ice skating lessons, and soccer clinics are typically offered to children as early as the toddler and preschool years. Many town recreation departments offer baseball, softball, basketball, lacrosse, hockey, tennis, and volleyball to elementary-school-age kids. As they age out of youth leagues, many kids can join middle school or high school sports teams or try out for a competitive travel sports team.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Music</a></h3>
							<p>Band and choir are popular elective courses in many schools. Children can also get private lessons or join a community youth orchestra or other music groups. Educational research suggests that kids who play musical instruments do better in academic school subjects.6 However, learning to play and appreciate music alone is a fantastic reward in itself.</p>
